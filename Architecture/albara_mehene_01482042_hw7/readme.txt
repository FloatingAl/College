Summary: In this assignment I first needed to use fork to create a child 
to create a child. We then were asked to report a collection of 
process and thread information about itself to standard 
out to create a unnamed pipe,then spawn a child 
process which will inherit access to thread
and access unnamed pipe. The parent process colleged the text
string into the pipe. Then the child function would read
the pipe message and change output. I mostly used the 
help file that was given to us. After that I needed to implment the case 0
function, default and case -1.  Overall the program
didn't take too long. Most likley because C is 
better to wrap my head around.
