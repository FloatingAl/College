Degree of Success: 90%

I wasn't fully successful in the previous homework and was not 100% confident if my program was working correctly. So I belived my best bet was to do the alternative of the assignment and just add the argument three times. All I needed to do was load in the argument from the stack into the accumlator and continue to add itself three times and return to the funtion. Some issues that I was encountering was the Loc being too small. At first I put 20 but was still too small. Just to be safe I made the LOc to be 200 and was able to print out the output. Over all the acumlator return the number tripled. If you were to continue, It would triple again the output. Overall simple program, though I would have prefreed to do the main assignment. Could have learned more from it than this. Most likley will work on hw5 and work on 6 later on in the future.
