1. I tested the my implementation by using Enqueue until it was full. Then for the dequeue I dequeued until it was empty. I used the size to check how many items and peek to check what the front of the array is.

2. The exceptions I implemented was the isFull and isEmpty. I would check to see if the buffer is full and it would exit. If it was empty, I would throw a exception of the buffer being empty.

3. It took 30 min. to correct my spacing for the RB implementation.
