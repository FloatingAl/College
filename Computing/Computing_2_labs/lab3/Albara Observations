So when when we make the file its runs normally, When we add a comment
in the main and make the file again, it only makes the main part only.
Same with add.c and mult.c. When I wrote a comment, I only changed the
add.c and mult.c. so it basically updated and only make file add.c and 
mult.c.

Example:
After making a file, I put a comment in my add and showed this only:
cc    -c -o my_add.o my_add.c
gcc main.o my_add.o my_mult.o -o main


With the .h files, it updates main.

Basically, adding a comment, just updates whats necessary insded of updating everything else.
