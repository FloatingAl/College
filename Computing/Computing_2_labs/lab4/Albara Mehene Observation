The bugs what were in the program, were all from the findCity.C. In the findCity function, the integer i was being used in the for loop and was being reinitialized as 0. We want to keep -1 because
it would return -1 if the location didn't exit. We needed to create another variable to implement the for loop and once it equals to -1 it breaks and returns 1.

Same with the findcity2, I needed to create another variable to implement the for loop and then break but if the area doesnt exist it will return -1.

gdp commands:

1.break) The break function was I would give it a line and the program will be 

2.run) The run was to just run the code until a breakpoint or the end.

3.continue) The continue was to continue after the breakpoint

4.Step) is useful to go to the next line of the breakpoint and reads it
