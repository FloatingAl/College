The point of this program was I was to take the added noded from the "AddNode"
function and was to take that node and arrange it with the other nodes
in the function "AddSort"

1) first I creaded another node and made space inside of it.

2) I then created current and made it the front of the node.

3)I then have current run through the nodes and check each time if the 
the value in the node was was greater than the next one.

4) I had to store the pointer to node temp2 and then made current point to
temp

5) I then equaled the temp to the pointer of temp2 and then included the new node.
