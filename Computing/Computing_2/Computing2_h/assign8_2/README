What I did)

1)So I created a another linklist called Sorted list to be able to put the smallest character to the the first index in the list.
2) I created 4 nodes to used in sorting the strings. two of them I set to the front of the list current and hold. prev and prevHold is to know the previous node

3)Then in the while loop I iterrated the size of the list to loop until it has no nodes left. In the while, I have to go through the list by making it checks each node in the list.

4) As it goes through the list,I call the less function, which compares which string is greater. If it returns 1, I set it will hold the orev node and then have it hold current.

5)After that, Hold next will the front of the list. and the front of the list will hold the next node to be iterated.
