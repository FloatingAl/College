1) Basically for most of the function I called the linklist in 
the queue function in a certain way.

2)Queueinit I called the linkedlistInitDefault to create the linklist 
itself.

3) Queue empty was to check if it was empty or not, so it would return
0 or 1.

4)Queueput was just called the linkedlistAddNodeBack and that was it
We only needed that function to create the nodes

5) the Queueget function, I created the tempde node to hold the value that linkedlist RemoveNodeFront so i can bring back the value that was removed in the front of the list

IMPORTANT: I created a static for linkedlist as global for all my function to use
