1) So what I did first was I tried to figure out which each of the functions 
did and which needed to be seperated or not.
2) After that, I created function declerations in the header file 
3) In the implementation file, I copyed and pasted all the parts of the code
that can isen't required in the main file.
4) I needed to make a ** to window and circle so I can acess the orginal 
value and change it.
