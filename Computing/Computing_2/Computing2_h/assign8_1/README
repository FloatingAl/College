Computing II

What I Did)

1) For the item, I create 2 strings that are both char* because we needed the user to enter strings. So for later it can determine which string is greater.

2) Now in the linkedlist Scaninit, I created a variable called input to link to data in the linklist. I made another variable called string so it can stop when the person is done.

3)I malloced enough space for each time they enter a string.

4) then had them enter a string, then giving the string to the Addnoteback and created a node that contains that info.

5) This will contine unti lthe user hits 0 to end the program.

6) For the linkedlistshow, I create Node temp and had to equal to the front of the list. Then I iterated through the list and printed out each node until it hits NULL.
